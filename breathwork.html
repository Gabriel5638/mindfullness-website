        <h2> Step 1: Get Comfortable </h2>
        <h3>Assume a meditation posture: sitting, lying down — whichever is most comfortable for you. 
        Make sure you can expand your lungs freely without feeling any constriction.</h3>  
    </div>
       
        
      <div class="second-step">  
        <h2>Step 2:  Deep Breaths</h2>
        <h3>Close your eyes and try to clear your mind. 
        Be conscious of your breath, and try to fully connect with it. 
        Inhale deeply through the nose or mouth, and exhale unforced through the mouth. Fully inhale through the belly, 
        then chest and then let go unforced. Repeat this 30 to 40 times in short, powerful bursts. 
        You may experience light-headedness, and tingling sensations in your fingers and feet. 
        These side effects are completely harmless.  </h3> 
       </div>
      

       <div class="third-step">
        <h2>Step 3: Hold</h2>
        <h3>After the last exhalation, inhale one final time, as deeply as you can. 
        Then let the air out and stop breathing. 
        Hold until you feel the urge to breathe again.</h3> 
       </div>
        

        <div class="fourth-step">
       <h2> Step 4: Recovery Breath </h2>
       <h3> When you feel the urge to breathe again, draw one big breath to fill your lungs. 
        Feel your belly and chest expanding. When you are at full capacity, hold the breath for around 15 seconds, then let go. 
        That completes round number one. 
        This cycle can be repeated 3-4 times without interval. 
        After having completed the breathing exercise, take your time to bask in the bliss. 
        This calm state is highly conducive to meditation — don't hesitate to combine the two.</h3>
