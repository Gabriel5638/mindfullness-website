 # Bugs and other issues
* The low performance in the lighthouse report is showing  because of the YouTube videos that use java script and YouTube ads. To fix this I would have to remove the YouTube videos, but I don't believe it is necessary as the site performs very well even with this low performance report.

# Deployment
  * The site was deployed to GitHub pages on my 5th attempt, my website just kept crashing when being uploaded but I managed to make it work by reuploading it to the root directory. 
 
 The steps I used to deploy are as follows:
 * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
 * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
 * Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
* The live link can be found here @[Mindfullness](https://gabriel5638.github.io/mindfullness-website/)
